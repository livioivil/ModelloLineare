flip                    The main function for univariate and
                        multivariate testing under a permutation (and
                        rotation) framework + some utilities.
flip-package            The library is devoted to permutation-based
                        inferential methods.
flip.object-class       Class "flip.object" (and related functions) for
                        storing the result of the function flip and
                        flipMix
flipMix                 The main function for testing mixed models
                        under a permutation (and rotation) framework
npc                     Functions for multiplicity corrections
permutationSpace        These functions handle the orbit of
                        permutation/rotation tests (i.e.
                        permutation/rotation space).
